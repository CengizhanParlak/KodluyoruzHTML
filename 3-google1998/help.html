    <section>
        <p>To enter a query into Google, just type in a few descriptive keywords and hit "search." That's it! If you
            need them, however, we also provide a few advanced search operators.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <font color="red">NEW!</font>
                    <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">The "" operator.
                    </font>
                </strong>
                <p>
                    Google automatically prefers pages where the query terms are found in close proximity. However,
                    sometimes the only relevant pages are those where some or all of the query words occur as a phrase.
                    You can enclose words in double-quotes</font> </b> (<tt>"like this"</tt>) to force the words to
                    appear together in all returned documents.</p>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <font color="red">NEW!</font>
                    <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">The - operator.</font>
                </strong>
                <p>Sometimes it is helpful to choose words to exclude from a search. That is, you want all relevant
                    result pages except those containing a certain word. We support this "not" functionality with the
                    "-" operator. Simply <b>
                        <font color="#38A808">prefix your query word with a -</font>
                    </b> (<tt>-like -this</tt>) to make Google ignore all pages containing that word.</p>
            <li>
                <b>
                    <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">Automatic AND.
                    </font>
                </b>
                <p>Google only supports "and" queries. That is, it only returns pages that include all the query terms.
                    The + operator, which enforces "and" behavior on some search engines, is unnecessary on Google
                    (though it can be used to include stopwords; see below).</p>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <p>The results of a Google search do a lot to help point you toward the right result: the <a
                href="legend.html">numbers in the results</a> help you figure out result quality, and the query
            word-sensitive content helps you figure out what the pages are about.</p>

        <p> The results can also be used for further exploration of the web. Click on the bar graph at the beginning of
            the result, and see <b>
                <font color="#38A808">what pages link to this page</font>
            </b>. </p>

        <p>Click on the "cached" link, and see what the <b>
                <font color="#38A808">page looked like when we indexed it</font>
            </b>. Has the page changed so much it doesn't hold the information you need anymore? Perhaps the version in
            the cache will be more helpful.</p>

    </header>

    <section>
        <p> The "I feel lucky" button automatically takes you to the first web page returned for your query. When it
            works -- and it often works -- it means less time searching for web pages and more time looking at them.</p>

            Want to limit your search to web pages regarding <a href="#">Linux</a>? Interested only in web pages at <a

        <p>
            Google does not support all of the operations found in all search engines. Many of these we plan on
            supporting in a future release.
        </p>
    </section>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">No "or" operator.</font>
            </b>
            <p>
                Most search engines will return pages that contain only some of the query terms, sometimes in preference
                to pages that contain all the terms! Google only returns pages that contain all the terms. There is no
                way to turn off this behavior. There is also no way to tell Google to accept pages containing either
                word A or word B. You must submit the query twice, once with word A and once with word B.
            </p>
        <li>
            <b>
                <font color="#38A808" face="arial,helvetica">Google doesn't
                    "stem."</font>
            </b>
            <p>
                Some search engines automatically expand your search, so when you type in "wood" it searches for "woods"
                as well, and maybe even "woody" or "wooden." There's some argument about whether this is good or bad,
                but Google does not support it. If in doubt, try both forms: "airline" <i>and</i> "airlines," for
                instance.
            </p>
    </ul>

        <h2>
            <font color="red" face="arial,helvetica"> Stopwords </font>
        </h2>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>
            Google removes common words such as "the" and "of" from the query before it starts to search. Use
            "<tt>+the</tt>" or "<tt>+of</tt>" to prevent the common word from being removed. This is sometimes helpful
            when the word is important for completing a phrase. </p>

        <p>
            Since some other search engines (but not Google) use "and" and "or" as search operators, Google ignores
            them. If you want to use "and" or "or" as actual query words, you can use "<tt>+and</tt>" or "<tt>+or</tt>".
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that you need to use "+" even within quotation marks. A query like <tt>"lord of the flies"</tt> will
            normally search for documents with "lord" and "flies" and any two words in between them. You can use
            <tt>"lord +of +the flies"</tt> to force those two words to be "of" and "the".
